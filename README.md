# Chopped

Generate random golang baskets for fun!

Try to build something from random parts!

## Downloading

`go get github.com/StabbyCutyou/chopped`

## Flags

`-c` will generate a number of baskets equal to the number you pass it

`-e` is "easy mode" - it will only generate "top level" packages, and you can use any of the sub-packages.

## Example

`./chopped -c=20 -e=true`
